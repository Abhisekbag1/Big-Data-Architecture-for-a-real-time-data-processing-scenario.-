# Big-Data-Architecture-for-a-real-time-data-processing-scenario.
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time big data processing architecture using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, HBase, Hive, and Python/Scala/Java. The architecture is designed to handle streaming data from sources like IoT sensors and logs, process it on the fly, and store it for querying and analysis.

# Tech Stack
1) Apache Kafka: For real-time data ingestion

2) Apache Spark Streaming: For processing data on the fly

3) HBase: For low-latency storage

4) Hadoop (HDFS): For raw data archival

5) Hive/Spark SQL: For querying and analysis

6) Python/Scala/Java: For implementatio
   
## Architecture Workflow
# Data Ingestion:

1) Collect real-time data from sources (e.g., IoT sensors, logs)

Use Kafka to stream data

2) Data Processing:

Implement Spark Streaming jobs for filtering, aggregation, and transformation

Detect anomalies and generate alerts

3) Data Storage:

Store processed data in HBase for fast retrieval

Archive raw data in Hadoop for batch processing

4) Data Analysis:

Use Hive or Spark SQL to query stored data

Visualize insights using dashboards
